TRIPPY

Trippy is designed to ease the stress of planning a trip by providing the tools you need all in the one place. I have often found when planning a trip that I make notes and lists, write several possible itineraries, keep track of expenses, keep track of travel information links etc., all of which are located in several different places on my computer. I wanted one place where I could keep track of everything. As Trippy is an online web app, this also means that all my planning - notes, lists etc. is accessible wherever I go. Further inspiration came from helping out friends with travel plans and wanting to design an app that makes it easy and straight forward for them.
